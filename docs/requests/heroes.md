# Requests from heroes

## Round 2 (open)

1. **Archive move blocked by core/ui/ai references (needs owners' changes).** Archive copies already exist at
   `src/heroes/archive/{kestrel,rampart,willow}.json` (subfolder, not scanned by `GameConfig.hero_ids()` /
   `UiCatalog`). The top-level originals are still in place, because removing them breaks code outside heroes:
   - `src/core/game_config.gd:15` default `hero_id := "kestrel"`: change it to e.g. `"twin_tails"`.
   - `tests/ui_test.gd:9` asserts `kestrel` is listed: assert a current hero instead.
   - `tests/core_control_sim.gd:31`, `tests/core_nav_maps_sim.gd:42,80` (kestrel, rampart) and
     `tests/ai_nav_driver.gd:4` (kestrel): point them at current heroes or `src/heroes/archive/…`.
   - `tools/capture_v02.sh` uses `--hero=rampart/willow/kestrel`.
   When these have landed, heroes deletes the three top-level files (one commit; tests already use archive paths).
2. **INTERFACES.md §2: melee primary.** Implemented entirely in heroes (hero.gd `_try_fire` branches on
   `primary.type`; core `Weapon` still handles rate/mag and ignores extra keys). Please document:
   `"primary": {"type":"melee","damage","fire_rate","mag","reload_time","range","arc_deg","combo":[mult…],
   "combo_window","finisher_knockback"}`. Hits are frontal arc (`MeleeMath.in_arc`), damage kind `primary`, final
   combo hit knocks back. Bots/HUD: melee range is `primary.range` (bot AI may want to close distance; ammo is 999).
3. **INTERFACES.md §2.2/§3: new hero API & ability options.**
   `damage_mult()` (= damage_scale × buff; all hero/ability damage uses it), `apply_buff(mult, dur, kb_immune)`,
   `knockback(v)` (ignored while `knockback_immune`), `add_overheal(amount, dur)` + `overheal` (absorbed before HP
   inside `take_damage`; the returned/applied amount includes absorbed overheal; HUD may show `overheal`),
   `clear_buffs()` on death. Ability def option `"needs_ult": true` (any type becomes an ultimate; consumes meter).
   New types: `leap` (query `leaping()`), `team_buff`. `ground_slam` now only impacts on landing after its own dive.
   Optional `color` param on heal_beam / ground_slam.
4. Still open from round 1: optional `"primary": {"type":"projectile"}` (not implemented).
5. Role string `"brawler"` is new (The Best); UI may want a label/icon.

## Round 1 (resolved in master 13df7ab/bbd8445)
Test auto-discovery, hero API docs, damage kinds, mixed bot roster.
